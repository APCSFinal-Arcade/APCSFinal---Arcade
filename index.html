    <!-- Laura's game -->
    <div class="game" name="game1">
      <p class = "game-title">A Wacky Mole Game</p>
      <p>
        <b>By L. Zhou. </b> The rules are simple: You have 60 seconds to click on moles and earn as many points as possible.
        Just good old Whack-a-Mole, with a twist: <b>ECONOMY+ABILITIES</b>.

      <p class = "game-title">Gamedev Canvas Workshop</p>
      <p>
        <b>By R. Qian. </b> Try to survive as long as possible without touching any red. Yellow indicates that it will become red soon. This game is best played on a monitor instead of a laptop.
